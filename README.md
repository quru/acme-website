# Simple demo web server

This is a very simple demo web server for testing purposes that you can run using Python 2.x.

To start the web server, clone this repo to your server, bring up a terminal and change
into the code directory, and run:

    $ sudo ./start_server.sh

Then browse to the home page at `http://<your-server-name>/`.
The server runs in the background and creates an access log file in the same directory.

To stop the web server, run:

    $ sudo ./stop_server.sh
